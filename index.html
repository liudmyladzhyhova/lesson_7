						bleachers and a memory suddenly came back to him—a spring day on that very spot. He and Sam Gordon
						facing each other, fists balled up, ready to slug it out. Sam was an 8th grader, a big kid—he’d been
						held back a year. He dressed in dark clothes that smelled of cigarettes and motor oil and he wore his
						anger the way some women wear too much costume jewelry. For no particular reason he’d taken an instant
						disliking to quiet Jim, who was a year younger and fifty pounds lighter. Sam had mercilessly tormented
						him all year until finally Jim had had enough and agreed to Sam’s taunt to fight it out after school.
